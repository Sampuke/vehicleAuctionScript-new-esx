Are you looking for a custom-made vehicle auction script for FiveM that is fully synced, configurable, and user-friendly? Look no further! I'm excited to present my latest creation - a custom vehicle auction script for FiveM that will take your server to the next level.

My script allows you to create and configure your own auction areas, set the duration of the auction, and even add map blips to make it easy for players to find.
